# ForgeFlow V2 - Integration Testing & Production Readiness

This directory contains the comprehensive Integration Testing & Production Readiness validation suite for ForgeFlow V2, implementing Issue #17 requirements.

## 🎯 Overview

The testing suite validates ForgeFlow V2 production readiness across all three phases of development:

- **Phase 1**: Foundation Layer (Knowledge, Memory, CLI)
- **Phase 2**: Intelligence Layer (Index, Retrieval, Context Assembly, ML)
- **Phase 3**: Final Integration (Evaluation, Installation, Production)

- Zero critical security issues
- Documentation validation passes
- Performance benchmarks meet targets

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Test timeouts**: Increase timeout values in vitest.config.ts
```typescript
test: {
  testTimeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
  hookTimeout: 10000  // 10 seconds
}
```

**Memory issues during load testing**: Reduce concurrent users or file count
```typescript
const loadTestConfig = {
  maxConcurrentUsers: 25, // Reduce from 100
  fileCount: 1000        // Reduce from 5000
};
```

**Database connection errors**: Ensure clean test environment
```bash
rm -rf .ff2/test/
npm run test:production
```

**Performance benchmark failures**: Check system resources
```bash
# Monitor during tests
htop
# Or on Windows
taskmgr
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debug logging
DEBUG=forgeflow:* npm run test:production

# Run specific test with verbose output
npx vitest run tests/integration/production-readiness.test.ts --reporter=verbose
```
