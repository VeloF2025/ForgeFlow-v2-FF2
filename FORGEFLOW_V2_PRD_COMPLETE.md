# Product Requirements Document: ForgeFlow v2
## True Parallel AI Orchestration System with Enterprise Protocols

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Complete Specification  
**Authors:** ForgeFlow Team  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Current AI development orchestration systems suffer from fundamental limitations:
- **ForgeFlow v1** executes agents sequentially despite claiming parallelism, creating bottlenecks
- **Context pollution** occurs when multiple agents share the same workspace
- **No persistent state** between development sessions leads to context loss
- **Limited visibility** into parallel work streams for team members
- **Manual coordination** required for complex multi-agent workflows
- **Hallucination risks** from AI suggesting non-existent code
- **Quality drift** without enforced standards

### 1.2 Solution Overview
ForgeFlow v2 is a revolutionary AI orchestration system that achieves **true parallel execution** with **zero-tolerance quality enforcement** by combining:
- GitHub Issues as a distributed task queue
- Git worktrees for isolated execution environments  
- Specialized AI agents with defined capabilities and protocols
- Mandatory safety protocols (NLNH, AntiHall, RYR)
- Zero-tolerance quality gates with automated enforcement
- Real-time progress visibility and audit trails

### 1.3 Key Benefits
- **10x faster execution** through true parallelism
- **Zero context pollution** via worktree isolation
- **100% traceability** through GitHub integration
- **Zero hallucinations** via AntiHall protocol
- **100% truth guarantee** via NLNH protocol
- **Team-scale collaboration** with real-time visibility
- **Enterprise-grade quality** with automated gates

## 2. Core Protocols & Rules

### 2.1 Mandatory Safety Protocols

#### 2.1.1 RYR (Remember Your Rules) Protocol
**Activation**: "Remember Your Rules", "RYR", "ryr"  
**Purpose**: Universal rules enforcement and compliance check

**Execution**:
```python
# Automatic trigger on any RYR command
python "C:\Jarvis\RYR_COMMAND.py"
```

**Enforcement Actions**:
1. Load ALL rules from CLAUDE.md and RULES.md files
2. Display PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md requirements
3. Check Docker agents and Archon integration status
4. Activate NLNH (No Lies, No Hallucination) protocol
5. Show Zero Tolerance Policy enforcement status
6. Provide color-coded compliance summary

#### 2.1.2 NLNH Protocol (No Lies, No Hallucination)
**Activation**: "NLNH" command or automatic on session start  
**Purpose**: Absolute truthfulness guarantee

**Core Principles**:
1. **Never lie or hallucinate** solutions
2. **Admit uncertainty** - Say "I don't know" when unsure
3. **Report failures transparently** - Show real errors
4. **Provide honest assessments** - No sugar-coating
5. **Document limitations** - Be explicit about constraints

**Violation Response**:
- CRITICAL FAILURE status
- Immediate acknowledgment required
- Correction with explanation
- Incident logged to audit trail

#### 2.1.3 AntiHall Validator Protocol
**Activation**: Automatic before ANY code suggestion  
**Purpose**: Prevent AI hallucination of non-existent code

**Validation Requirements**:
```bash
# Before suggesting any code
npm run antihall:check "methodName or code snippet"

# Required validations
- Service methods: antihall:check "authService.login"
- Components: antihall:check "ProjectListComponent"  
- Hooks: antihall:check "useNeonProjects"
- Routes: antihall:check "/app/projects"
- Database: antihall:check "projects collection"
```

**Impact Metrics**:
- Time saved per hallucination: ~40 minutes
- Detection speed: 2 seconds vs 40 minutes debugging
- Accuracy: 100% prevention rate

### 2.2 Quality Gates (Zero Tolerance)

#### 2.2.1 Pre-Commit Validation
**Mandatory checks before EVERY commit**:
```python
python "C:\Jarvis\UNIVERSAL_RULES_CHECKER.py" --path "." --pre-commit
```

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ Zero ESLint errors/warnings
- ✅ No console.log statements
- ✅ No commented-out code
- ✅ >95% test coverage
- ✅ All Playwright tests passing
- ✅ Security scan clean
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met

**Enforcement**: Commits BLOCKED if any check fails

#### 2.2.2 Code Quality Standards
```yaml
Linting:
  TypeScript: Zero errors, Zero warnings
  ESLint: Zero errors, Zero warnings
  Prettier: Auto-formatted

Testing:
  Unit: >95% coverage
  Integration: All passing
  E2E: All critical paths covered
  Performance: <1.5s page load, <200ms API

  OWASP: Top 10 covered
  
Code Structure:

  Duplication: <3%
```

### 2.3 Golden Guardrails - RULES.md System

#### 2.3.1 Automatic Rules Enforcement
**Session Start Protocol**:
```python
# Run immediately when Claude starts
python "C:\Jarvis\UNIVERSAL_RULES_CHECKER.py" --path "."

# Check hierarchy
1. RULES.md (Highest priority)
2. CLAUDE.md (Project overrides)
3. Global CLAUDE.md (Defaults)
```

#### 2.3.2 Rules Management
```python
# Create if missing
python "C:\Jarvis\rules_enforcer.py" create --path "."

# Update after commits
python "C:\Jarvis\rules_enforcer.py" update --path "."

# Validate before changes
python "C:\Jarvis\rules_enforcer.py" validate --path "."
```

## 9. Risk Management

### 9.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| GitHub API rate limits | High | Medium | Implement caching, batch operations, use GraphQL | Fallback to local queue |
| Worktree conflicts | Medium | Low | Automated conflict resolution, isolation | Manual merge assistance |
| Agent failures | Medium | Medium | Retry logic, fallback agents, circuit breakers | Manual intervention |
| Context size limits | High | Low | Context compression, chunking, pruning | Distributed processing |
| Performance degradation | High | Medium | Resource monitoring, auto-scaling | Vertical scaling |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Low | Regular scanning, updates, pen testing | Immediate patching |

### 9.2 Operational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Adoption resistance | High | Medium | Training, documentation, migration tools | Gradual rollout |
| Integration complexity | Medium | High | Standardized APIs, adapters | Custom integrations |
| Skill gap | Medium | Medium | Training programs, documentation | Expert support |
| Change management | Medium | High | Phased migration, backward compatibility | Dual-system period |
