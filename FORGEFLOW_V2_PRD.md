## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Current AI development orchestration systems suffer from fundamental limitations:
- **ForgeFlow v1** executes agents sequentially despite claiming parallelism, creating bottlenecks
- **Context pollution** occurs when multiple agents share the same workspace
- **No persistent state** between development sessions leads to context loss
- **Limited visibility** into parallel work streams for team members
- **Manual coordination** required for complex multi-agent workflows

### 1.2 Solution Overview
ForgeFlow v2 is a revolutionary AI orchestration system that achieves **true parallel execution** by combining:
- GitHub Issues as a distributed task queue
- Git worktrees for isolated execution environments  
- Specialized AI agents with defined capabilities
- Zero-tolerance quality gates
- Real-time progress visibility

### 1.3 Key Benefits
- **10x faster execution** through true parallelism
- **Zero context pollution** via worktree isolation
- **100% traceability** through GitHub integration
- **Team-scale collaboration** with real-time visibility
- **Enterprise-grade quality** with automated gates
