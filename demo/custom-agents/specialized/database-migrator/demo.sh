  ✅ Set up monitoring and alerting
  ✅ Create shadow tables for dual-write

PHASE 2: Schema Evolution (5 minutes) 
  ✅ Add new columns with default values
  ✅ Create new indexes concurrently
  ✅ Set up triggers for dual-write
  ✅ Validate schema changes

PHASE 3: Data Migration (15 minutes)
  ✅ Enable dual-write mode
  ✅ Migrate data in batches (10k records/batch)
  ✅ Transform data for multi-tenancy
  ✅ Validate data integrity continuously

PHASE 4: Cutover (2 minutes)
  ✅ Switch application to new schema
  ✅ Remove old columns and indexes
  ✅ Clean up migration artifacts
  ✅ Update application configuration

PHASE 5: Validation (3 minutes)
  ✅ Run comprehensive data validation
  ✅ Performance testing
  ✅ Application smoke tests
  ✅ Monitoring verification

🔄 Rollback Plan:
  • Automatic rollback triggers:
    - Data integrity check failure
    - Performance degradation >20%
    - Application error rate >1%
    - Manual intervention required
  • Rollback duration: <5 minutes
  • Data loss risk: ZERO (due to dual-write)
