## Epic: User Dashboard Analytics Feature

This epic demonstrates ForgeFlow v2's parallel AI orchestration capabilities by implementing a complete dashboard analytics feature.

### 🎯 Objectives
- [ ] Implement ProjectOverview component with real-time data
- [ ] Create RecentActivity component with activity feed
- [ ] Build API integration layer replacing mock data
- [ ] Add authentication store with user management
- [ ] Implement theme store for dark/light modes
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite (95%+ coverage)
- [ ] Add performance optimizations (React.memo, lazy loading)
- [ ] Update documentation (JSDoc, README)

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **Components**: React functional components with TypeScript
- **State**: Zustand stores for global state management  
- **API**: Axios-based service layer with error handling
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support

### 🚀 Parallel Development Plan
FF2 will orchestrate 5 AI agents working simultaneously:
1. **Component Developer**: ProjectOverview & RecentActivity components
2. **API Integrator**: Replace mocks with real endpoints
3. **State Manager**: Authentication and theme stores
4. **Test Engineer**: Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Performance Optimizer**: Bundle optimization and memoization

### 📊 Success Metrics
- Zero TypeScript/ESLint errors
- 95%+ test coverage
- <200ms API response times
- Lighthouse performance score 90+
- Complete documentation coverage

### ⏱️ Expected Timeline
- **Traditional Sequential**: ~45 minutes
- **FF2 Parallel**: ~8 minutes
- **Performance Gain**: 5.6x faster development
