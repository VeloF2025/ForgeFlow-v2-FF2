# ForgeFlow v2 Demo Project

This is a sample React TypeScript application designed to demonstrate ForgeFlow v2's parallel AI orchestration capabilities. The project intentionally contains various states of completion and TODO items to showcase how FF2 can orchestrate parallel development work.

## 🎯 Demo Purpose

This project serves as a **realistic codebase** for FF2 to orchestrate, featuring:

- **Incomplete Features**: Components with TODO comments and missing functionality
- **Technical Debt**: Areas marked for refactoring and improvement
- **Testing Gaps**: Test files that need to be written or expanded
- **Documentation Needs**: Code that needs better documentation
- **Performance Issues**: Components that could be optimized

## 🏗️ Project Structure

## 🎬 FF2 Demo Scenarios

### 1. Feature Development Pattern
FF2 will orchestrate parallel development of:
- **Component Implementation**: Building missing React components
- **State Management**: Completing Zustand store implementations
- **API Integration**: Converting mock services to real API calls
- **Testing**: Writing comprehensive test suites
- **Documentation**: Adding JSDoc comments and README sections

### 2. Bug Fix Sprint Pattern
FF2 will identify and fix issues like:
- **TypeScript Errors**: Missing type definitions and imports
- **Accessibility Issues**: Adding ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance Problems**: Implementing React.memo and optimization
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fixing responsive design issues

### 3. Quality Enhancement Pattern
FF2 will improve code quality through:
- **ESLint Fixes**: Resolving linting warnings and errors
- **Test Coverage**: Achieving 95%+ test coverage
- **Code Documentation**: Adding comprehensive comments
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing best practices

## 🔍 Intentional Issues for Demo

The following issues are intentionally included for FF2 to demonstrate fixing:

### Components with Issues:
- **Header.tsx**: Missing search and notification functionality
- **Navigation.tsx**: Needs mobile responsive design
- **StatsCards.tsx**: Using mock data instead of real API
- **ProjectOverview.tsx**: Missing component entirely
- **RecentActivity.tsx**: Missing component entirely

### Store Issues:
- **useProjectStore.ts**: Mock API calls instead of real endpoints
- **useAuthStore.ts**: Missing authentication store
- **useThemeStore.ts**: Missing theme management

### Missing Files:
- **src/services/api.ts**: API service layer
- **src/hooks/useApi.ts**: Custom API hook
- **src/components/LoadingSpinner.tsx**: Loading component
- **src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx**: Error handling
- **tests/**: Complete test suite

## 🚀 Running the Demo

### Prerequisites

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript types

## 🎯 Expected FF2 Improvements

After FF2 orchestration, this project should have:

### ✅ Quality Metrics
- **TypeScript**: Zero errors, full type coverage
- **ESLint**: Zero warnings or errors
- **Test Coverage**: 95%+ coverage across all components
- **Performance**: Lighthouse score 90+
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### ✅ Feature Completeness
- **Search Functionality**: Working search in header
- **User Management**: Complete authentication flow
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data refresh
- **Mobile Experience**: Fully responsive design
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries

### ✅ Developer Experience
- **Documentation**: Complete JSDoc coverage
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites
- **Development Tools**: Enhanced dev experience
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle and runtime

## 📊 Demo Metrics

FF2 will track and report:

- **Development Time**: Traditional vs parallel execution
- **Code Quality**: Before/after metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Coverage improvements
- **Performance**: Bundle size and runtime improvements
- **Documentation**: Documentation coverage increase

## 🎪 Live Demo Features

When running the demo:

1. **Real-time Dashboard**: View FF2 orchestration progress
2. **GitHub Integration**: See Issues and PRs created automatically
3. **Parallel Worktrees**: Multiple git branches with agent work
4. **Quality Gates**: Live quality metrics and enforcement
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Resource usage and optimization

## 📝 Notes for Demo Users

This project is designed to showcase FF2's capabilities:

- **Don't Fix Issues Manually**: Let FF2 demonstrate its orchestration
- **Watch the Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working simultaneously  
- **Check the Quality Gates**: Zero-tolerance policy in action
